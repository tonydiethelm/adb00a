# adb00a Avantos Challenge

Hi! My name is Tony Diethelm. I saw the job opening on LinkedIn, and was intrigued. 

I sent a POST to https://apply-to-avantos.dev-sandbox.workload.avantos-ai.net with a body of {"email": "tonydiethelm@gmail.com"}. 
I used Postman, and had to set the User-Agent to "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"

I received the following back:

```

{
    "challenge_link": "https://fluttering-atmosphere-1b5.notion.site/Journey-Builder-React-Coding-Challenge-190d5fe264fa80cba39ec21afc6d42ec",
    "instructions": "Submit your solutions as a link to a github repo named `adb00a` to the following email address: challenge-request-sub-aaaapriy22ktilybsd6gv7beiq@avantos.slack.com. Questions can be sent to challenge-help-aaaaprjeraoxiaa2wlnlda7vsi@avantos.slack.com"
